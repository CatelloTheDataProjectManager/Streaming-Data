# Real-Time Web tracking with Segment and Mixpanel

## Data Streaming
I have experience working with data streaming, a method of sending and receiving data continuously and in real-time. This method is commonly used in online music and video streaming, social networks, online gaming, real-time monitoring applications, and more.

## Segment
I am familiar with Segment, a data collection and management platform. Segment allows businesses to collect data from various sources such as websites, mobile apps, servers, and databases, and then send it to analytics, marketing, and data storage tools.

## Customer Data Platform (CDP)
I have worked with Customer Data Platforms (CDPs), software systems that collect, unify, and organize customer data from various sources to create a single, comprehensive view of each customer. CDPs help businesses better understand their customers and provide personalized experiences by leveraging data from multiple channels and touchpoints.

## Amplitude, Google Analytics or Mixpanel
I have experience using Amplitude, a product analytics platform that allows businesses to track and understand user behavior on their websites and mobile apps. Amplitude provides advanced analytics tools to help businesses identify trends, understand user journeys, and optimize the user experience.

## Event Segmentation
I have experience working with event segmentation, the process of grouping user actions or events into meaningful categories or segments based on specific criteria. Event segmentation helps businesses gain a deeper understanding of user behavior, identify patterns and trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve user experience and drive business outcomes.
